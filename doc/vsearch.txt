vsearch is a simple plugin that enhances the native grep mechanism and uses sed to facilitate in-editor file search & replacement.

Note: it's best combined with a 'rooting' plugin (such as vim-rooter: https://github.com/airblade/vim-rooter) which anchors the editor
to the root project working directory regardless of the location of the file being edited underneath.

===

Installation:

Vundle is the supported installation mechanism. See https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim for Vundle installation instructions.

Once Vundle is installed and configured, installation is as simple as adding the following to the plugin sections of your ~/.vim/vimrc:

  Plugin 'movitto/vim-vsearch'


Quit & restart vim (or refresh your vimrc)

vsearch provides two commands:

  :VSearch <grep-args>

  :VReplace <search> <replace> [file] [file]....


:VSearch is a simple enhancement ontop of the 'grep!' mechanism built into VIM, relying on the external 'grep' program
to perform a search. Besides invoking 'grep!' so as _not_ to automatically bring up the first search result, VSearch opens
the quickfix buffer containing the search results. With :VSearch one can run a search against their project (or any
portion) and see the results, without interrupting their current environment/workflow.


:VReplace first runs a search in a similar manner to :VSearch using the specified search and file arguments. Note files may
be in any form accepted by grep, including directories and regex patterns.

The substitution will be performed in memory and the temporary results output to the user who is then prompted for confirmation.

If cancelled, no further action is performed, but if confirmed, the 'find' and 'sed' programs are invoked with the necessary
options to perform the replacement.

===

Configuration:

vsearch relies on the 'grep', 'sed', and 'find' programs to execute it's functionality. If not configured, these will be
loaded from their default locations (/usr/bin/) and if they still cannot be found, VSearch and VReplace will fail with
errors.

The default locations may be overloaded with the following options:

  g:vsearch_grep - /usr/bin/grep
  g:vsearch_sed  - /usr/bin/sed
  g:vsearch_find - /usr/bin/find
